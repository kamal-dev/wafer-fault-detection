# Classification Problem on Wafer Fault Detection

## Introduction
While the manufacturing of the silicon, there are varios instances where silicon wafer can go faulty. This project on wafer fault detection will classify whether a given wafer is faulty or not based on the sensor data.

## Environment Setup
